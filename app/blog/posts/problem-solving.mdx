For growth and self-development, there are so many opinions.<br />
The important thing is to learn by myself through execution.<br />
So today, I want to summarize what I feel and what is important to me, and establish my own principles.

# 1. Define the problem
```
let x;
```
<br />
- First, define the problem.
- The purpose of defining the problem is to identify the gap between my current state and my desired future state, so I can work towards narrowing it.
- During the process of defining the problem, it is important to acknowledge both internal and external factors with extreme realism.

<br />
# 2. Think about solutions
<br />
```
function solve(x) {
	//logic
	return result;
}
```
- Find solutions to the problem through **logical thinking**.
- Most problems tend to have more than one solution. Choose the one where the gap between the "fundamental solution" and the "currently feasible solution" is the smallest.
- Solutions must be backed by evidence, and this evidence should be something I can explain clearly in writing or verbally.

<br />
# 3. Execute the solution
<br />
```
while (true) {
	solve(x);
}
```
<br />
- Execute the solution I thought about to solve the problem.
- It is important to execute as quickly as possible.

# + Detail
## Repetition
 - If I have solved the problem once, I need to repeat the cycle until I achieve satisfactory results.
 - People who have never tried dieting before are much more likely to succeed than those who have tried it once.
 - Execution is not a one-time thing; it is an endless loop.

## Reflection
- I need to record these precious moments and processes instead of letting them evaporate.
- Recording allows me to judge the past problem most objectively and realistically.

## Antifragile
- The future `variable x` is unpredictable
- But the function `f(x)` that takes `x` as a parameter can be prepared.
- It is the most ideal structure for growth.

## Mind
- Practice is like a real battle, and a real battle is like practice.
- What doesn't kill me makes me stronger.
